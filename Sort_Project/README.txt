This program was written and compiled using JDK version 10.0.2.
You may recompile to a lower version, though it may not run. The main method is located in AlgoComparator.

I've included a JAR file for convenience, though the source, and class files are also included.
it can be ran (with the appropriate JRE) with java -jar AlgoComparator.jar

The program must be ran from the command line and presents four options:

1:	Selection Sort
2:	Merge Sort
3:	Quick Sort
99:	Exit
